# Sales Report Generator

## Program Description 
This program reads data from a team map file, a product master file, and a sales file then calculates team reports and 
product reports, and finally writes these reports to output files. This program can be executed by running report.py in
the console in this folder.

## Requirements
Python version 3.10 or higher is required to run this program. Ensure Python has been installed on your system and has 
been added to your PATH.

## Input Files
The input files, which are the team map, product master, and sales file, should all be .csv files that contain the data 
described below.

### Team Map
Each row in the team map should correspond to one team and should have 2 columns:
* **Column 1**: Team ID (*int*)
* **Column 2**: Team Name (*string*)

The team map should also have a header, which can be anything you choose.

### Product Master
Each row in the product master should provide information about a single product and should have 4 columns:
* **Column 1**: Product ID (*int*)
* **Column 2**: Product Name (*string*)
* **Column 3**: Unit Price (*float*)
* **Column 4**: Lot Size (*int*)

### Sales
Each row in the sales file should correspond to one sale and should have 5 columns:
* **Column 1**: ID of the sale (*int*)
* **Column 2**: ID of the product sold (*int*)
* **Column 3**: ID of the team that made the sale (*int*) 
* **Column 4**: Lots Sold (*int*)
* **Column 5**: Discount given in percent (*float*)

## Output Files

* **Column 1**: Team Name
* **Column 2**: Gross Revenue of this team (before discounts, rounded to nearest cent)

## File locations
The file locations have defaults set in utils/file_IO/config.py which can be overwritten.

* The default location for the input files is at /Input Files
* The default location for the output files is at /Output Files

The file names have defaults set in utils/file_IO/config.py, but may be overwritten by command line arguments which are
